# Modelling-and-Numerical-Simulation-of-the-Sterile-Insect-Technique-for-Mosquito-Population-Control


 This was my final degree project for my BSc in Applied Mathematics and Computation at IST. It concerns feedback control strategies for applying the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) to eliminate mosquito populations. Several control strategies are analyzed for two types of population models.
 Numerical simulations that illustrate the effectiveness of these strategies are presented. Additionally, a
 cost minimization problem is formulated as an optimal control problem, with the goal of reducing the total
 number of sterile males released while ensuring mosquito population extinction.
